# Write a `longest_word` method that accepts a string (`sentence`) as its only argument.
# The method should return the longest word in the sentence.
# If two words are tied for maximum length, the method should return the last word in the sentence with that length.
# You can assume:
#   - each word in the sentence is separated by a single space
#   - the sentence does not contain any symbols or characters, including punctuation.
